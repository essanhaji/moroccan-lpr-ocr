# Moroccan License Plate OCR


## Summary

The project is a multiclass characters classification model build using deep learning algorithms.
Our model used to recognize Moroccan license plate recognition characters that we extract from the license plate in previous steps.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this part is collected from a different source and some of them generated by downloading a bunch of Arabic fonts and loop over every font and every needed character and wrote in images using PIL then store them.

You can find it [here](dataset.rar).

**Note :** That we use the data augmentation technique in Keras.


## Model Architecture

The convolutional neural network architecture that we use to perform this task of multiclass weed species classification is [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146) that already implemented in Keras high-level API of TensorFlow.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 64bit
- Windows 10 64 bit / version 1909
- Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 laptop
- cuda_11.0.2_451.48_win10
- cudnn-11.0-windows-x64-v8.0.1.13
- Bazel 3.1.0

## Recommended

Note that is better to create a new virtual environment and install requirements in it to isolate your project from your default environment and to avoid all problems that caused by version conflict.

- The first think is to install ``virtualenv``.

  ``` 
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

- Clone the project.

  ```
  cd moroccan-lpr-ocr
  ```

- Now the folder venv is you main environment and you can name it what are every you want. and all the packages you will install it will store there.

  ```
  virtualenv \venv
  ```

- To activate your virtual environment.

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

- Now you can install any python packages you want in the command line that you are activating the virtual environment and they will be isolated.

- To exit the virtual environment. 

  ```
  deactivate
  ```

- For more information check [her](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/virtual-environment-in-python).


## Requirements

- Get the package from PyPi.

- All requirements that you will need with its version it's exist in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) so you need just to run this command to install it all :

  ```
  !pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Download the pre-trained weight [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yukW03-cSyICnoyD9astn4EdeaAEJFBF/view?usp=sharing) then add it to `\Checkpoint` folder.

## How to run it

When you install all requirements pick in the repository and make sure to activate your virtual environment then start ``jupyter lab`` environment.

```
jupyter lab
```

Then open the browser and tap [``http://localhost:8888/lab``](http://localhost:8888/lab) and do the heck you want with it.


## Training the model

Note in the notebook we add a clause to test if the model already exists in the path `\Checkpoint` before we create and compile a new one so that we launch training many times for a small number of epochs.

You don't need to download the pre-trained weight if you want to retrain the model from the beginning.

For monitoring reasons, we are using the [`Livelossplot`](https://github.com/stared/livelossplot) that is shown in the training phase.
